## Introduction to Git

Git is a distributed version control system that helps you track changes, collaborate with others, and manage your project's history effectively.

## Getting Started

To begin using Git, you'll first need to install it on your system. Download and install Git from the [official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Once installed, open a terminal or command prompt and configure your identity using the following commands:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```

## Basic Git Commands

### 1. Initializing a Git Repository

**Usage:** When starting a new project.

**Example:**
```bash
git init
```

### 2. Checking Repository Status

**Usage:** To see the status of files in your repository, including changes to be committed and untracked files.

**Example:**
```bash
git status
```

### 3. Adding and Committing Changes

**Usage:** To save changes and create a new version.

**Example:**
```bash
git add <file>  # Add a specific file
git commit -m "Commit message"
```

### 4. Viewing Commit History

**Usage:** To see the history of commits, including who made them and when.

**Example:**
```bash
git log
```

### 5. Ignoring Files

**Usage:** To prevent certain files from being tracked by Git.

**Example:** Create a `.gitignore` file with patterns to ignore.

## Working with Branches

### 1. Creating a Branch

**Usage:** When starting a new feature or fixing a bug, it's good practice to create a new branch to isolate the changes.

**Example:**
```bash
git branch <branch_name>
```

### 2. Switching Branches

**Usage:** To switch between different features or bug fix branches.

**Example:**
```bash
git checkout <branch_name>
```

### 3. Merging Branches

**Usage:** To combine changes from one branch into another, typically after completing a feature or fixing a bug.

**Example:**
```bash
git merge <branch_name>
```

## Collaboration and Remotes

### 1. Cloning a Repository

**Usage:** To start working on an existing project.

**Example:**
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

### 2. Pushing Changes

**Usage:** To share your local changes with others in a remote repository.

**Example:**
```bash
git push origin <branch_name>
```

### 3. Pulling Changes

**Usage:** To get the latest changes from the remote repository and merge them into your local branch.

**Example:**
```bash
git pull origin <branch_name>
```

## Advanced Git Commands

### 1. Rebasing

**Usage:** To integrate changes from one branch into another while maintaining a linear commit history.

**Example:**
```bash
git rebase <branch_name>
```

### 2. Tagging

**Usage:** To mark specific points in history, such as release versions.

**Example:**
```bash
git tag <tag_name>
```

### 3. Cherry-Picking

**Usage:** To apply a specific commit from one branch to another.

**Example:**
```bash
git cherry-pick <commit_hash>
```
## Team Workflows

### 1. Feature Branch Workflow

The core idea behind the Feature Branch Workflow is that all feature development should take place in a dedicated branch instead of the main branch. This encapsulation makes it easy for multiple developers to work on a particular feature without disturbing the main codebase. It also means the main branch will never contain broken code, which is a huge advantage for continuous integration environments.

...

Example using Suzanne and Prashant:

#### Suzanne begins a new feature
Feature Branch Workflow: commit changes
Before she starts developing a feature, Suzanne needs an isolated branch to work on. She can request a new branch with the following command:

**Example:**
```bash
git checkout -b suzannes-feature main
```

#### Meanwhile, Prashant is doing the exact same thing
While Suzanne and Prashant are working on suzannes-feature and discussing it in her pull request, Prashant is doing the exact same thing with his own feature branch. By isolating features into separate branches, everybody can work independently, yet developers can still have visibility into each others' changes and can collaborate as needed.
