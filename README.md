## Introduction to Git

Git is a distributed version control system that helps you track changes, collaborate with others, and manage your project's history effectively.

## Getting Started

To begin using Git, you'll first need to install it on your system. Download and install Git from the [official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Once installed, open a terminal or command prompt and configure your identity using the following commands:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```

## Basic Git Commands

### 1. Initializing a Git Repository

**Usage:** When starting a new project.

**Example:**
```bash
git init
```

### 2. Checking Repository Status

**Usage:** To see the status of files in your repository, including changes to be committed and untracked files.

**Example:**
```bash
git status
```

### 3. Adding and Committing Changes

**Usage:** To save changes and create a new version.

**Example:**
```bash
git add <file>  # Add a specific file
git commit -m "Commit message"
```

### 4. Viewing Commit History

**Usage:** To see the history of commits, including who made them and when.

**Example:**
```bash
git log
```

### 5. Ignoring Files

**Usage:** To prevent certain files from being tracked by Git.

**Example:** Create a `.gitignore` file with patterns to ignore.

## Working with Branches

### 1. Creating a Branch

**Usage:** When starting a new feature or fixing a bug, it's good practice to create a new branch to isolate the changes.
A repository can host multiple branches, serving as a method to structure project-related tasks. Each branch can be designated for various purposes, such as implementing a new feature, experimenting with innovations, or investigating an issueâ€”essentially, any task within the project scope.

Creating a fresh branch for every task, no matter how minor, is a recommended approach. This is particularly beneficial when initiating work on a new feature. Branches are easily disposable, allowing for their removal whenever necessary.

**Example:**
```bash
git branch <branch_name>
```

### Git Branch Naming Convention [^2]

When working on projects that may transition from a one-man team to a 20-developer team, maintaining a manageable code repository is crucial. Many Proof of Concept projects start with changes applied directly to the *Main* branch. As projects grow, establishing a proper branching strategy becomes essential.

That being said, there is no universal convention for naming branches. One approach could be to view branch types under two general categories:

#### 1. Code Flow Branches

These branches represent the progression of code changes from development to production.

- **Development (`dev`):**
  All new features and bug fixes should be brought to this branch. Resolve code conflicts early in this stage.

- **QA/Test (`test`):**
  Contains code ready for QA testing.

- **Staging (`staging`, Optional):**
  Contains tested features for stakeholder review before production deployment.

- **Main (`main`, formerly `master` [^1]):**
  The production branch, serving as the default presented branch.

[^1]: A note on 'main' versus 'master' branch:
In the spirit of fostering a more inclusive and sensitive environment, it's inportant to note that the computer industry's use of the terms master and slave caught everyone's attention in the summer of 2020. Amid the many protests and the growing social unrest, these harmful and antiquated terms were no longer considered appropriate. The industry has since been making efforts to move away from these terms, including renaming branches from "Master" to "Main" in version control systems like Git. For more information, you can read about why GitHub renamed its master branch to main [here](https://www.theserverside.com/feature/Why-GitHub-renamed-its-master-branch-to-main).

Except for Hotfixes, the code should follow a one-way merge path: `development` > `test` > `staging` > `production`.

#### 2. Temporary Branches

These branches are disposable and serve specific purposes.

- **Feature:**
  Use this branch for new module or use case development, based on the current development branch. Examples:
  - `feature/integrate-swagger`
  - `feature/JIRA-1234`
  - `feature/JIRA-1234_support-dark-theme`

- **Bug Fix:**
  If fixes are needed post-release, they should be done on the `bugfix` branch. Examples:
  - `bugfix/more-gray-shades`
  - `bugfix/JIRA-1444_gray-on-blur-fix`

- **Hot Fix:**
  For immediate critical fixes, create a `hotfix` branch that can be merged directly into production and later into development. Examples:
  - `hotfix/disable-endpoint-zero-day-exploit`
  - `hotfix/increase-scaling-threshold`

- **Experimental:**
  Use this branch to experiment with new features or ideas not part of a release or sprint. Examples:
  - `experimental/dark-theme-support`

- **Build:**
  A branch specifically for creating specific build artifacts or conducting code coverage runs. Examples:
  - `build/jacoco-metric`

- **Release:**
  Use this branch for tagging a specific release version. Examples:
  - `release/myapp-1.01.123`

- **Merging:**
  Temporary branch for resolving merge conflicts or finalizing merges between different branches. Examples:
  - `merge/dev_lombok-refactoring`
  - `merge/combined-device-support`

### 2. Switching Branches

**Usage:** To switch between different features or bug fix branches.

**Example:**
```bash
git checkout <branch_name>
```

### 3. Merging Branches

**Usage:** To combine changes from one branch into another, typically after completing a feature or fixing a bug.

**Example:**
```bash
git merge <branch_name>
```

## Collaboration and Remotes

### 1. Cloning a Repository

**Usage:** To start working on an existing project.

**Example:**
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

### 2. Pushing Changes

**Usage:** To share your local changes with others in a remote repository.

**Example:**
```bash
git push origin <branch_name>
```

### 3. Pulling Changes

**Usage:** To get the latest changes from the remote repository and merge them into your local branch.

**Example:**
```bash
git pull origin <branch_name>
```

## Advanced Git Commands

### 1. Rebasing 
(also see [Merging vs. Rebasing](#merging-vs-rebasing))

**Usage:**  Git rebasing is a technique used to integrate changes from one branch into another while modifying the commit history into a linear structure. Here's a summarized explanation:

- **Objective:**
  - *Rebasing* aims to incorporate changes from one branch (usually a feature branch) onto another (often the main branch), ensuring a linear, cleaner commit history.

- **Process:**
  - Commits from the feature branch are replayed on top of the target branch, starting from a common ancestor. This creates a new, modified commit history.

- **Advantages:**
  - *Cleaner History:* Rebasing helps maintain a linear commit history by incorporating feature changes seamlessly into the main branch.
  - *Easier to Understand:* The commit history becomes more readable and chronological, making it easier to follow the development flow.

- **Considerations:**
  - *Conflicts:* Conflicts may arise during the reapplication of commits. These need to be resolved manually.
  - *Use Cases:* Rebasing is particularly useful for feature branches, aligning them with the latest changes in the main branch before merging.
  
- **Usage:**
  - To rebase, use the command `git rebase <target-branch>`. This moves the current branch to the latest commit of the target branch and replays the changes.

In essence, rebasing facilitates a cleaner, more linear commit history by incorporating changes from one branch into another, resulting in a more readable and organized project history.

**Example:**
```bash
git rebase <branch_name>
```


### 2. Tagging

**Usage:** In Git, tagging a commit involves creating a named reference (a "tag") that points to a specific commit. Tags are used to mark significant points in a repository's history, such as version releases, important milestones, or commits that are notable for some reason. Here's why you might tag a commit:

1. **Release Management:**
   - Tags are commonly used to mark specific versions or releases of the software. For instance, you might tag a commit that represents a stable release of your software (e.g., v1.0.0). This allows for easy reference to that particular version in the future.

2. **Documentation and Reference:**
   - Tagging helps in creating a stable reference point for documentation or user guides corresponding to a particular version of the software. It ensures that the documentation corresponds accurately to the released version.

3. **Reproducibility:**
   - Tagging commits enables you to reproduce a specific state of the codebase at any point in the future. This is critical for debugging, testing, or understanding how the application behaved at a particular release.

4. **Collaboration:**
   - When collaborating with a team, tagging commits provides a standardized way to communicate important updates, ensuring that all team members are aware of specific milestones or versions.

5. **Hotfixes and Patches:**
   - Tags can be used to mark commits that correspond to critical hotfixes or patches applied to a production version. This allows for easy identification of these important changes.

6. **Integration Points:**
   - Tags can be used to mark integration points with other systems or services. For instance, when integrating with third-party libraries or APIs, you might tag the commit that aligns with a specific version of that integration.

7. **Historical Annotations:**
   - Tags act as historical annotations, allowing you to quickly navigate and refer to crucial moments in the project's timeline, providing context and understanding of the development history.

8. **Long-Term Maintenance:**
   - When a project reaches a stable state and may not be actively developed, tagging is crucial for maintaining the codebase for potential bug fixes or security updates.

In summary, tagging commits is an essential practice in Git to mark specific points in the project's history, making it easier to manage, reference, and reproduce different versions of the codebase, as well as communicate important milestones and changes effectively.

**Example:**
```bash
git tag <tag_name>
```

### 3. Cherry-Picking

**Usage:** To apply a specific commit from one branch to another. Cherry-picking a commit is akin to selecting and applying a specific change or set of changes from one branch to another. Let's break down the analogy into real-life terms and understand how and why you might use cherry-picking:

#### Analogy: Crafting a Custom Cake

Imagine you're a pastry chef working on two different cake projects simultaneously, and you have a repertoire of cake recipes.

1. **Working on Cake A and Cake B:**
   - **Cake A** needs a special strawberry frosting (commit A), while **Cake B** requires a unique blueberry filling (commit B).

2. **Committing Changes:**
   - You make the changes for both cakes but realize that the strawberry frosting (commit A) is exceptionally good and could also enhance Cake B.

3. **Cherry-Picking:**
   - Instead of taking all the changes from Cake A (which may include changes irrelevant to Cake B), you specifically pick and apply only the strawberry frosting (commit A) to Cake B.

4. **Result:**
   - Cake B now has the fantastic strawberry frosting, even though it was initially intended for Cake A.

#### How and Why Would You Cherry-Pick a Commit in Software Development?

- **Scenario 1: Bug Fixes:**
  - Imagine you discover a critical bug (commit) in a stable version of your software (branch). You've already fixed this bug in a development branch. You can cherry-pick this fix into the stable version without applying other changes from the development branch.

- **Scenario 2: Feature Backport:**
  - You've developed a new feature (commit) for the next major release (branch). However, a client using the current stable release requests this feature urgently. You can cherry-pick the commit into the stable version without including other changes that are not ready for release.

- **Scenario 3: Independent Changes:**
  - You have a branch with multiple commits for different improvements. One of these commits is a small but essential change that's needed in another branch. Cherry-picking allows you to pick just that particular change and apply it where needed.

- **Scenario 4: Merging Selective Changes:**
  - During a merge, you may have conflicts or unwanted changes from one branch that you don't want in another. Cherry-picking lets you merge specific changes from one branch into another, avoiding the bulk merge of the entire branch.

Cherry-picking, in essence, is about selectively choosing and applying specific changes (commits) from one context (branch) to another, helping to keep changes focused and controlled, thus enhancing code management and flexibility in software development.

**Example:**
```bash
git cherry-pick <commit_hash>
```
## Team Workflows

### 1. Feature Branch Workflow [^3]

The core idea behind the Feature Branch Workflow is that all feature development should take place in a dedicated branch instead of the main branch. This encapsulation makes it easy for multiple developers to work on a particular feature without disturbing the main codebase. It also means the main branch will never contain broken code, which is a huge advantage for continuous integration environments.


**Example: Suzanne and Prashant each have their own feature branches**

Suzanne begins a new feature. Before she starts developing a feature, Suzanne needs an isolated branch to work on. She can request a new branch with the following command:

**Example:**
```bash
git checkout -b suzannes-feature main
```

Meanwhile, Prashant is doing the exact same thing. While Suzanne and Prashant are working on suzannes-feature and discussing it in her pull request, Prashant is doing the exact same thing with his own feature branch. By isolating features into separate branches, everybody can work independently, yet developers can still have visibility into each others' changes and can collaborate as needed.

## 2. Git Rebase and Merge

This section provides an overview of the `git rebase` command and its comparison with the `git merge` command, along with practical applications and considerations for integrating rebasing into the Git workflow.

### Merging vs. Rebasing

The `git rebase` command can significantly simplify the development process -- but it must be used with caution. Below we'll compare `git rebase` with `git merge`, exploring when and how to use them effectively.

### Conceptual Overview

Git rebase and git merge are both used to integrate changes from one branch into another but operate in distinct ways. Git merge creates a "merge commit" that ties the histories of both branches, resulting in a non-destructive operation. However, it can lead to a cluttered feature branch history if main is actively updated.

**The Merge Option**

Merging the main branch into the feature branch using `git merge` creates a merge commit and preserves the complete history.

```plaintext
*   Merge branch 'main' into feature
|\  
| * Commit C3 (main)
| * Commit C2 (main)
| * Commit C1 (main)
|/  
* Commit F2 (feature)
* Commit F1 (feature)
```

However, it can lead to a cluttered feature branch history if main is actively updated.

**The Rebase Option**

Rebasing the feature branch onto the main branch using `git rebase` results in a linear project history.

```plaintext
* Commit C3 (main)
* Commit C2 (main)
* Commit C1 (main)
* Commit F2 (feature)
* Commit F1 (feature)
```

However, it can be potentially catastrophic if used incorrectly and loses the context provided by a merge commit.

**Interactive Rebasing**

Interactive rebasing allows altering commits during the rebase process, providing complete control over the branch's commit history.

```plaintext
* Commit C3 (main)
* Commit C2 (main)
* Commit C1 (main)
* Commit F3 (feature - squashed)
```

This is useful for cleaning up a messy history before merging a feature branch into the main branch.

**The Golden Rule of Rebasing**

The golden rule of git rebase is to avoid using it on public branches to prevent confusing history and diverging main branches. Force-pushing should be used cautiously and preferably on private branches.

### Workflow Walkthrough

Rebasing can be integrated into the Git workflow at various stages of a feature's development:

1. **Local Cleanup**: Periodically perform an interactive rebase to clean up in-progress features and make commits more focused and meaningful.

2. **Incorporating Upstream Changes**: Incorporate upstream changes from the main branch using either `git merge` or `git rebase` to keep the feature branch up to date.

3. **Reviewing a Feature with a Pull Request**: Clean up code with an interactive rebase before submitting a pull request to present a clean and easy-to-follow feature branch history.

4. **Integrating an Approved Feature**: Rebase the feature onto the main branch to maintain a linear history before merging the feature into the main codebase.

### Summary

Understanding when and how to use `git rebase` and `git merge` allows you to choose between a clean, linear history using rebase and a complete project history with merge. Both options are valid, and leveraging the benefits of `git rebase` can lead to a more streamlined Git workflow.
